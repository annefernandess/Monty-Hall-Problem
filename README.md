# Monty Hall Problem

## Overview

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the television game show "Let's Make a Deal", Monty Hall. The problem is as follows: You are presented with three doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats. You choose a door, say Door 1. Before revealing what's behind Door 1, the host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, say Door 3, revealing a goat. The host then gives you the option to switch your choice from Door 1 to Door 2. Should you switch? What is the probability of winning the car if you switch versus if you stick with your original choice?

## Gameplay

The game requires two players:
1. The contestant who makes the initial door selection.
2. The host who reveals a goat behind one of the remaining doors and offers the contestant the chance to switch their choice.

To select a door:
- Click on the door itself.

To open a door:
- Click on the door handle.
